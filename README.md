# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll find a collection of my software development projects. I've worked on a variety of projects, from desktop applications to web development and machine learning architectures. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each project.

## [Calculator](Calculator/README.md)

This is a desktop calculator application written in Python. It features a user-friendly interface and supports basic arithmetic operations. The source code and more details about the project can be found in the [project's README](Calculator/README.md).

## [IoT Dashboard](IoT-Dashboard/README.md)

This is an online IoT dashboard application. It's a full-stack JavaScript application, with a React frontend and a Node.js backend. The dashboard allows users to monitor and control IoT devices in real-time. More details about the project, including the source code, can be found in the [project's README](IoT-Dashboard/README.md).

## [Neural Network Architecture](Neural-Network/README.md)

This project is a neural network architecture implemented using only numpy. It's a demonstration of how neural networks work at a fundamental level, without the use of high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The source code and more details about the project can be found in the [project's README](Neural-Network/README.md).
